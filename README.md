# About Me

Doctor in Bioengieering currently based in Ancona (The Marches, Italy). 

University projects and thesis research sparked my interest in data analysis and visualization. This led me to develop a strong skillset in these areas, ultimately guiding me toward a Data Analyst career path.

A (popular) principle I believe in: "Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated"

## Academic Projects (add repositories links):
- To improve the performance of an ASP-based rehabilitation scheduling system, I conducted a detailed analysis of such system: I compared the original ASP output to the coordinator's modified schedule to identify implicit assignment factors. This led to the creation of new ASP rules and constraints, informed by real-world scheduling practices, aiming to optimize the encoding's effectiveness.
- I developed a classifier of facial expressions (serious or smiling) and gender using the FEI face database, a carefully controlled set of images. To ensure consistent analysis, images underwent preprocessing steps such as resizing, grayscale conversion, and formatting. I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore the dataset and understand the role of different features in classification. Next, I built and tested several classification models, including Naive Bayes Classifier (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), and a combination of Linear Discriminant Analysis with Naive Bayes (LDA NB). Model performance was compared using metrics like error rate, sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under ROC (AUC), revealing the superiority of the LDA NB model. Finally, I employed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to pinpoint the most crucial facial features (eigenfaces) for differentiating between expressions and genders.
- Within the Biomedical Robotics course, I explored key concepts through hands-on projects: i) Sistem modeling: simulation of a DC motor's dynamics using Simulink; ii) Robot Control: implementation of a MATLAB model for the forward and the inverse kinematics of a 2D planar manipulandum; iii) NeuroRehabilitiation: creation of an interactive 3D virtual environment in Simulink for neuro-rehabilitiation purposes, featuring both force and viscous fields, where a user interacts with targets using a Phantom Omni haptic device robot. Target interaction can be either assisted or hindered by the robot allowing different degrees of assistance.
- Hands-on projects for the Biomedical Imaging course allowed me to get a basic understanding of: mathematical operations between images; binary masking; image transformation, filtering and noise removal; histogram equalization, adjustment and thresholding; contrast enhancement and adjustment: definiton of a Region Of Interest (ROI); Image object's area computation; creation of macros in ImageJ; filling, erosion and opening of images; cell counting; Image representation and operations in Fourier Domain; Filtering in Fourier Domain: low- and high-pass filtering (Butterworth filters) of images; Morphological operators; Image registration: registration of MRI scans (volumes) using fiducial points or by maximizing Mutual Information using a pyramidal approach; Image reconstruction from sinograms using the filtered back-propagation algorithm.
- In the Computational Neuroscience project, I simulated a Regular Spiking neuron and an Intrinsically Bursting neuron using the Izhikevich Model. I investigated the responses of neurons, their under-threshold and supra-threshold working conditions (voltage-threshold) and their gain (IFR Vs Current amplitude), when stimulated with steps or noisy steps of DC-currents with varying amplitude.
- During Research Track, I implemented a superburst detection algorithm (Wagenaar et al., "Persistent dynamic attractors in activity patterns of cultured neuronal networks", 2006; Wagenaar et al., "An extremely rich repertoire of bursting patterns during the development of cortical cultures", 2006.). Superburts temporal structure was evaluated using two kind of similarity indexes and return plots.
- In the Neural Signal Analysis project, I investigated the impact of a brain lesion on connectivity between the rostral forelimb area (RFA) and primary somatosensory area (S1) in rats. Chronically implanted electrodes were used to record brain activity before and after inducing a lesion in a group of rats (ET1), while a control group (SHAM) remained unlesioned. My analysis, using the phase-locking value (PLV) across several frequency bands, suggested that the lesion decreased connectivity between the RFA and S1 regions. This decrease was less evident for connections within the areas themselves. Intriguingly, the control group also exhibited some connectivity changes, highlighting the need for careful interpretation of these findings. This work demonstrates the potential of PLV as a metric to study how brain lesions affect communication pathways. It could ultimately contribute to improved diagnosis, monitoring, and targeted rehabilitation approaches for brain injuries.

My Bachelor Thesis focused on the Time-Frequency analysis of muscular recruitment in patients affected by Parkinson's disease. Muscular activation was assesed in time-frequency domain using the wavelet transform on EEG singnals acquired from muscles involved in gait. Contraction onset was determined by thresholding the power-spectra of the transformed signal and compared with motion-analysis-derived gait data.

In my Master Thesis I implemented Machine Learning based approaches to identify non-obvious relationships between clinical and biological features in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). The proposed Data Analysis and Machine Learning pipeline successfully stratifies CLL patients in homogeneous groups, revealing non-obvious relationships among features and identifying potential markers of differential in vivo stimulation.
In this context I've also gain knowledge on Biclustering Algorithms, on the Combinatorial Auction Structured Search (CASS) algorithm and on the creation of synthetic data.
