In my Master Thesis I implemented Machine Learning based approaches to identify non-obvious relationships between clinical and biological features in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). The proposed Data Analysis and Machine Learning pipeline successfully stratifies CLL patients in homogeneous groups, revealing non-obvious relationships among features and identifying potential markers of differential in vivo stimulation.
